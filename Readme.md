Basic info :
==============

Here Raspberry Pi acts as node server . Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that uses the V8 engine developed by Google for use in Chrome. V8 compiles and executes JavaScript at lightning speeds mainly due to the fact that V8 compiles JavaScript into native machine code.

Moreover Node.js uses event loop. The event loop is a single thread that performs all I/O operations asynchronously.
